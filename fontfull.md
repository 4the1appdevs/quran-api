## Fonts with -full Suffix:
- These fonts were created by merging the Arabic fonts with [Noto Sans Arabic](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-arab) font, which has complete [Arabic Unicode Support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script_in_Unicode).
- A [Simple Script](https://superuser.com/a/1594984/1200777) was used to merge the fonts.
- These -full suffix fonts can be used for [IndoPak Quran](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/quran-api@1/editions/ara-quranindopakuni.json), which uses rare arabic symbols from [Extended-A block](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf)
